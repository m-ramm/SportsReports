# Time and Task Management

Implementing a system that allows the members of a project to track the amount of work and time spent on certain tasks is essential to ensure the completion of a project and guarantee that each member has fairly contributed to the project. 

Not only does such a practice prevent disputes about workload placement, but it also helps with estimating an accurate completion date for each section of the project. 

Furthermore, for aspiring engineers like us, this allows people to be accustomed to keeping others updated on their time and workload for each contribution.


## Task Allocation Options
-	The task can be allocated based on interests and talents within the field

-	Randomize tasks that have been split up equally to each member

-	Allow members to choose a section of the project themselves and try to get them to equal distribute the work amongst themselves

## Time Tracking Options
-	Members of the project can fill in timesheets, specifying which task they worked on and how long they spent for each task, allowing for a rough estimate on how long each member spent on each task

-	A program can be designed to monitor how long a member has spent on any certain task and record the contribution

## Task Tracking Options
-	A repository can be used to track each members contribution with a program calculating the percentage of work submitted by each member

-	A quick meeting can be held at the start of each day with each member revealing their progress to the scrum master so that the project is on track with schedule

-	A deadline could be set to keep members on track with the project schedule and members with each member evaluated as either ‘on-time’ or ‘being schedule’ with the people marked with the latter option having to spilt work with a member ahead of schedule whilst also deducting contribution points from them 

## Simplicity of Task tracking and Time tracking
-	The tracking systems should generally be self-explanatory, however, when the tracking system is complicated, the scrum master should create a guide for the members so that their time and tasks for the project can be effectively tracked

-	The scrum master should be available to consult with the process in which members are tracked, in case they are ever confused with submitting their time and tasks on the project

-	If Google Doc or Trello is used for the project, a program should not be required to track tasks and the scrum master should be able to view each members contribution easily without the need for the members involvement.

## Task and time tracking policies allowing enough marking information
-	The contribution of each member should be organised by the scrum master to be easily readable with the marker being able to understand all aspects of the tracking results

-	The tracker should always include the following for each member:
    o	Time spent on each task
    o	Percentage of tasks done by them
    o	Whether each deadline was met

## Does the marker have access to the project?
-	The scrum master should ensure that the allocated marker can view the project at any given time without the need to request access
