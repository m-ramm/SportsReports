# Non-Functional Requirements  
## 1. Usability  
- Pages are responsive to all screen sizes, this means users on tablets, phones and computers can all use the
application conveniently and responsively
-   The app avoids User error by providing various options in a drop down menu rather than the taking input from the user.
- The app is easy to operate and fun to use.
- Stats page has labels to help user interpret data.
## 2. Maintainability 
- Should aim to use ‘pure’ functions (can be reused in other parts of codebase, easily traceable errors)  
- Features should be built with knowledge that they will be scaled to extend to other sport types  
## 3. Reliability  
- Fetching and storing data needs to be consistent  
- Performance is consistently high speed
- If the application fails, it fails in a predictable way that doesn't crash the browser and still allows the user to navigate the app
