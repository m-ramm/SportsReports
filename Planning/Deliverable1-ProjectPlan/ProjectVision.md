# Project vision
## Why we are here
Currently the main sports reporting web applications are not user friendly, they have cluttered interfaces that are difficult to navigate. Our goal as a team is to create an aesthetically pleasing, simple web application that provides the basic sports information and statistics that the average sports fan require. 

## Elevator pitch
For: Basketball, soccer and cricket fans
Who: Enjoy keeping updated on the latest statistics for their sports
The: Sports Reports Web App
Is a: Sports statistic tracking web app
That: Allows users to access all their sports statistics in a convenient location  
Unlike: ESPN Sports Centre our application will have a much cleaner UI that enables fast and easy access to any stats the user desires
Our product: promises to provide a much simpler and elegant UI which is user friendly and meets all the requirements that the users actually care about.

## Product box
### The top three reasons people will use our app
Reliable Statistics: Users will come to our website to stay updated on their sports, therefore, users will be expecting reliable and up to date information. 
Convenience: Users want convenience, they want to be able to open the web app and quickly navigate to the information they desire; therefore, sports reports need to have fast performance and an easily navigated interface.
Enjoyment: This web app is targeted towards the average sports fan who follows the sport in their free time for fun, therefore, this web application should provide an enjoyable experience free of frustrating interfaces and slow connections.

## Meet out neighbours
Our neighbours include
    1. Website hosting service: https://www.hostinger.com/special-webhosting-offer?utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=aff2952&utm_campaign=31&session=102ad7aa47bcdcd65161282e46fb9a
    2. Soccer/Basketball API: https://www.api-football.com/widgets and https://www.api-basketball.com/, this project heavily relies on these APIs having accurate and up to date data, fortunately both APIs have excellent documentation and have continuing support. However, long term it would be sensible to develop our own API to reduce dependencies
    4. Gitlab: this project heavily relies on version control as all team members will work on different sections on different devices, however, Gitlab is very reliable, therefore, this is not a concern 
    5. Slack/Messenger: the group will mainly use messenger and slack to communicate, if these were to fail, communication would be halted, again this is effectively a non-issue due to the reliability 

## What keeps us up at night
Overreliance on APIs. Sports Reports requires consistently updated accurate data, if one of the APIs is discontinued or goes down for a period the application will completely lose function, fortunately, the APIs the team selected seem to be very reliable.   
Having part-time team members, every team member has other units, therefore, the team may run into issues where they have other priorities

## Size it up
Step 1: Planning ~ 2 weeks
Step 2: UI design and navigation (HTML/CSS) ~ 2-3 weeks
Step 3: Combining UI with back end data, integrating API calls and presenting data to user ~ 1-2 weeks
Step 4: Testing and polishing ~ 2 weeks

## What will give
Will give:
    - Number of sports
    - Compromise on the number of leagues per sport
    - Compromise on the number of widgets for each sport e.g. just league table and stats over live matches
Will not give:
    - Quality of the UI
    - Time taken to complete project
    - Budget (already at the minimum)


## What it will take
This project will take 5 people 7 weeks to complete for a budget of $7.50. The $7.50 is for hosting the web application
Each team member should spend 5+ hours on the project per week to ensure a quality product is delivered on time
