## **1. Scheduling Errors**<a name="sched"></a>
>### **Description**
>In the event that the timeline of the project is underestimated, and sprint deliverables are not delivered on time or up to scratch.  
>### **Impact and Likelihood**
>The likelihood of this happening is quite high, as it is tough to get a guage of exactly how long certain tasks will take, given that many factors are at play.  
>If this happens during the project, the impact would be moderate. Certain tasks would need to be pushed back to the next sprint and certain features may have to be delayed. The product backlog would be need reconfiguration.
>### **Monitoring Strategy**
>Each team meeting, need to address concerns relating to the schedule. Scrum master should touch base with developers frequently to make sure they are on track.
>### **Mitigation Plan**
>Catching any scheduling flaws early will help the process. Once they are identified, extra personel can be shifted from features that are ahead of schedule to help implement the tougher feature.

## **2. Team Member Leaves / MIA**
>### **Description**
>If a team member leaves midway through a sprint, and is not reachable by any communication.
>### **Impact and Likelihood**
>The likelihood of this occurring is quite low, as it is unusual for a team member to go complete radio silence.  
>The impact of a member leaving would be very high, as it would leave their portion of the sprint incomplete, potentially missing crucial code/data needed for the delivery.
>### **Monitoring Strategy**
>Frequent meetings to check progress will also help identify team members who have gone MIA. Furthermore, checking git frequently will identify members who are not actively doing work (IE members not pushing anything)
>### **Mitigation Plan**
>In the event that this does happen, an urgent meeting will be scheduled to discuss how the missing persons remaining tasks will be delegated between remaining members. This may also involve changing what will be delivered in the current sprint (IE delaying a feature)

## **3. May Have Feature Creep**
>### **Description**
>When unnecessary and excessive new features keep getting added to the project. May lose the practicality and could bloat the software, conflicting with the project vision, and detracting from user experience.
>### **Impact and Likelihood**
>The likelihood of this occurring in this project is quite low, especially during this semester alone. The likelihood may increase if the project is to continue into the future.  
>The impact would be moderate. While feature creep will not ruin the project, it may decrease its effectiveness due to bloat, especially if feature creep continues for a long period.
>### **Monitoring Strategy**
>Consult with the product owner about what features are fundamental for the project and contribute meaningfully. Product backlog should be frequently maintained and adjusted with this mindset.
>### **Mitigation Plan**
>Have clear requirements at project inception. At each meeting with the product owner, revise all features that are in the queue for their usefulness to the project. Lower the priority/remove features that conflict with the project vision at each revision of the product backlog.

## **4. Ambiguous Requirements from Client**
>### **Description**
>May occur when the product owner does not have a clear understanding of what features they want in the project.
>### **Impact and Likelihood**
>Moderate likelihood, as there are certainly features the product owner may want, yet they cannot express it well or have not thought extensively about what exactly they want from it.  
>Low impact, as the requirements can be clarified
>### **Monitoring Strategy**
>After requirements are added, have a team meeting to confirm that everyone is happy with the specificity.
>### **Mitigation Plan**
>If requirements from the product owner are vague, schedule another urgent meeting with them to clear up issues. If the product owner cannot elaborate further, a choice can be made to either axe the feature, or for the scrum master and team to fill in the blanks and continue implementing the feature.  

## **5. Temporary Illness/Incapacitation**
>### **Description**
> Occurs when a team member is temporarily out of action and cannot contribute to the project for a certain period (EG has COVID)
>### **Impact and Likelihood**
>### **Monitoring Strategy**
>### **Mitigation Plan**

## **6. Conflict in Future Direction of Project**
>### **Description**
>### **Impact and Likelihood**
>### **Monitoring Strategy**
>### **Mitigation Plan**

## **7. Loss of Data / Code**
>### **Description**
>### **Impact and Likelihood**
>### **Monitoring Strategy**
>### **Mitigation Plan**

## **8. Client Unsatisfied After Sprint**
>### **Description**
